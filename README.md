# Configuration

This mod can become quite noisy. To have control over this, a configuration file is provided by this mod. It is located at `/Risk of Rain 2/BepInEx/config/com.Xay.EnemyHitLog.cfg`, generated after Risk of Rain 2 has been launched once with BepInEx with the mod installed. 

## Toggles

You can toggle the following:

- Player logging `([true]|false)`
- Ally logging, i.e. Engineer Turrets, Beetle Guard or Aurelionite `(true|[false])`
- Utilities logging, i.e. Drones & Turrets `(true|[false])`
- Fall damage logging `([true]|false)`
- Shrine of Blood logging `(true|[false])`

Setting all toggles to `false` lets the mod become inactive.

If you wish to disable Debuff logging by itself without wanting to deactivate damage logging, simply set `Debuffs` to `false`.

## Filters

You can filter out messages in the following ways:

- `DamageToMaxHealthThreshold`: Do not log any damage which has a lower value than the given percentage of the Player's HP. For example, if this variable is `10`, only damage as high as at least 10% of the Player's max. HP (not counting barrier and shield) will be logged to the chat. Default value is `5`.

# Installation

Drop the `EnemyHitLog.dll` into your `/Risk of Rain 2/BepInEx/plugins` folder.

# Known Bugs/Missing Features

- Some attacks may not be tracked by the RoR2 Hook, such as Clay Dunestriders' regeneration attack when it gets low HP
